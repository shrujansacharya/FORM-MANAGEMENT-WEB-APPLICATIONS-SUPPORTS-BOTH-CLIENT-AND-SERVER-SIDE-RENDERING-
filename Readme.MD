FORM MANAGEMENT WEB APPLICATIONS SUPPORTS BOTH CLIENT AND SERVER SIDE RENDERING 


1. The objective of this project was to build a dynamic form-based application with both client-side and server-side rendering using EJS (Embedded JavaScript) and Express.js. This hybrid approach allowed rendering of templates on the server and interactive features on the client.

2. The project uses Express.js for routing, EJS for server-side rendering of HTML templates, and JavaScript for client-side interactivity. CSS is used for styling. The form accepts user inputs and stores them using a MongoDB model (User.js).

3. Key features include:

Admin dashboard (admin.ejs) to view submitted data.

CRUD operations with views: create (create.ejs), edit (edit.ejs), and list (users.ejs, dashboard.ejs).

Secure routes and environment setup via .env file.

Modular routing using routes/dashboard.js and proper MVC separation.
